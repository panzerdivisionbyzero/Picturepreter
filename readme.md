# About the project
The Picturepreter is kind of graphics editor that performs user-written LUA script for each pixel. It's mainly designed for custom mixing 2 or more images, but it can be used for one image as well.  
The script is processed asynchronously by multiple threads.

# Usage instructions
### 1. Basics:
- Use "+" or "X" buttons (top-left corner) to specify source images number;
- Load images for all defined inputs; The result image dimensions are defined by source images intersection;
- Edit script as you want (see point 3 in this section for more details);
- Click "Run script" button; "Result image preview" radio button should be selected automatically to show result image;
### 2. Other features:
- Switching between images preview: click on the radiobuttons corresponding to the images (top-left corner); Alternatively use CTRL+{1..9} shortcut;
- Swapping source images: click the "v" button to swap [n] source image with [n+1] source image;
- Interpolation mode selection: changes display smoothing;
- Pixel info format checkboxes: changes visibility and format of pointed pixel info;
- Image Pointer: click left mouse button on the image preview to point pixel constantly; click right mouse button to clear selection;
- Script output text box: displays user-defined debug messages and (in case of error) script error information with full script printout;
- Load/Save script (always with load/save dialog);
- Save result image (without Image Pointer; always with save dialog);
### 3. Script global variables and functions:
```
- imagesPixels[imageIndex] = {A,R,G,B} // source images pixel
- result = {A,R,G,B} // result image pixel
// for read/use only purposes:
- chunkStartX
- chunkStartY
- chunkLastX
- chunkLastY
- imageW
- imageH
- currentX
- currentY
- imagesCount
- CastToByte(int) // returns "byte" (int within range: [0..255])
- TableLength(tab) // returns int
- DebugEachPx(str) // prints given string into output text box
- DebugForPx(x,y,str)
- DebugChunkBegin(str)
- DebugChunkEnd(str)
- DebugImageBegin(str)
- DebugImageEnd(str)
```
